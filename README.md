# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
Robin assigned us to adjust the cubrrent web page to include al four of the hemisphere images on the web app. In order to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of the images, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter. We were then to use our Python and HTML skills to add to our scraping.py file. We were to update the file in our Mongo database and then modify the index.html file so the webpage contains all the information that was collected in the module as well as the full-resolution image and titles for each of the image. Finally, Robin wanted to us to update our web app to make it mobile-responsive by adding two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
